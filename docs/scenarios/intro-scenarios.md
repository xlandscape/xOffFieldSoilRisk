# Scenarios (under preparation)

## Introduction

The local co-occurrence of arable fields and off-field areas (eg, field margins, hedges, riparian zones, wood margins, graslands), their slopes, structure and management, together with environmental conditions, are key drivers of potential pesticide exposure and risk of off-field-soil organisms. A technical representation of certain geographic area (or artificial composition) covering these driving factors is what we call a ***scenario***.  
In regulatory RA, scenarios are typically selected (and designed) to represent conservative conditions for the risk of non-target-organismsm. Model outcome using such scenarios are intended to cover a larger range (typically >90%) of real-world conditions as occurring in a regulatory unit (eg, a country).  

## Example Scenarios

Example scenarios introduced in the publication to the xSR model in IEAM: [A spatiotemporally explicit modeling approach for more realistic exposure and risk assessment of off-field soil organisms](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.4798) or also open access and available at Github:
