# Scenarios (under preparation)

## Introduction

The local **co-occurrence of arable fields and off-field areas** (eg, field margins, hedges, riparian zones, wood margins, graslands), their slopes, structure and management, together with environmental conditions, are key drivers of potential pesticide exposure and risk of off-field-soil organisms. A technical representation of certain geographic area (or artificial composition) covering these driving factors is what we call a ***scenario***.  
In **regulatory RA**, scenarios are selected and designed to represent a certain **protection level** for the entirety of situations in a given regulatory unit (eg, a country). **Conservative** scenario conditions for the risk of non-target-organismsm are protective for a large fraction of populations (typically >90%) and are basically used at lower-tier RA levels. Using a **realistic landscape-level scenarios** allows to obtain insights on real-world risk drivers and to define adpated risk mitigation and management measures. This is further improved when using a **variety of more realistic landscape-level scenarios**.  

## Off-Field Soil Areas

Formally, the **off-field areas starts at the property boundery** of the field (see scheme in [Background](/docs/index.md#background)).  
However, as this **can be anything** and as the idea of the forthcoming pesticide regulation of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) ([“addressing the state of the science on RA of PPPs for in-soil organisms” (EFSA PPR Panel, 2017)](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/4690)) is to protect soil organisms, **relevant off-field soil habitats** need to be identified which are **subject to off-field soil RA**.  
In **real-world** cultivated regions often arable fields directly border to each other or to rural roads (with artificial road substructure banks and no natural soil). So in scenario development a first step is analyse cultivated regions for (semi)natural off-field soil land cover types, from which scenarios are then being ***constructed***.  
The development and definition of **relevant off-field soil habitats** is part of the discussions in the regulatory scientific community.

## Example Scenarios

### Publication (Open Access)

Example scenarios introduced in the publication to the xSR model in IEAM: [A spatiotemporally explicit modeling approach for more realistic exposure and risk assessment of off-field soil organisms](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.4798) are also open access and available at Github:

### Schematic Scenarios

different purposes  

- represent a single edge-of-field situation
- learning
-  

<img src="../img/scenario-schematic1.png" width="500" height="250">  

Schematic scenario 1 - 'Grassland' type.

<img src="../img/scenario-schematic2.png" width="500" height="250">  

Schematic scenario 2 - 'Riparian' type.

1. 'Grassland'-type  
large off-field area; yet, also margins of large areas
mostly direct vicinity to arable fields
single field as exposure source
representing, eg, grassland, wood, urban; wood-margin, urban-margin  
1. 'Riparian'-type
bordering to 2 fields
representing, eg, ditch/stream riparian zone, off-field hedge
