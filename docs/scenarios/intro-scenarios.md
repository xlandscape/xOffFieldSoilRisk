## Introduction



### Publication (Open Access)

The publication to the xOSR model also contains an introduction access publication in IEAM: [A spatiotemporally explicit modeling approach for more realistic exposure and risk assessment of off-field soil organisms](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.4798).  
The xOffFieldSoilRisk approach has been presented at different scientific conferences: (xxx include pdfs of the presentations.)

### Tiered Approach

xxx Depending on the purpose of bee (pollinator) forage modelling,  

1. off-the-shelf data: covering large geographic regions
1. best-available data, including manual processing
1. contemporary data generation: high-resolution drone mapping
1. field study: best possible landscape mapping, bee forage quantification and modelling
