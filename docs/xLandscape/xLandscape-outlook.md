## Integrated Development Environment

(IDE)

### for Building Landscape Models

- visual composition of landscape models

### for Building Components

- codeless

## Client-Server / Web-based Use

## Version 2.x

The design of version 1.x was influenced by the goal to combine existing models (often such established in regulatory RA) into a landscape-scale modelling composition.  
Since then, 

- new smaller process models that integrate better into spatiotemporally explicit landscape-scale simulations
