In its initial version, xOffFieldSoil has been composed using exposure models which are established in the regulatory scientific exposure assessment of pesticides in Europe (eg, FOCUSsw). However, these models are not open source and come with limitations for their spatiotemporally explicit operation with a large number of local conditions as typical at landscape-level. Future versions of xOffFieldSoilRisk are intended to consider exposure modules more adapted for integrating in landscape-level applications.  </p>"},{"location":"index.html#xsr-outcome-for-risk-assessments","title":"xSR Outcome for Risk Assessments","text":"<p>Basically, xOffFieldSoilRisk model outcome aims to be to be directly used in off-field-soil RAs. To this end, exposure endpoints need to be developed that fit into current RA schemes, in particular to lower-tier TER (Toxicity Exposure Ratio) and RQ (Risk Quotion) based approaches. Thus, raw spatiotemporally explicit model outcome needs to be aggregated into ready-to-use exposure values. To keep this process transparent, we propose a stepwise approach, including visualisations, to enable an understanding of the level of conservatism of aggregated exposure values. Therefore, at the present initial phase, this process is implemented as Jupyter Notebooks and R. The analysis steps can be executed manually (and adapted) using the Jupyter Notebooks, or can be conducted automatically at the end of an xSR model run (as xSR component).  </p> <p>A second option to use xSR model output is to link xSR directly with effect models (eg, TKTD, Folsomia, Eisenia, Earthworms). These effect models will be implemented as components (moduls) and integrated into xSR and will deliver RA endpoints at the level of defined SPGs (Specific Protection Goals, EFSA PPR Panel 2017)), eg, on species population level.  Although at scientific and technical level the necessary bits and pieces are ready, the establishment of landscape-level SPG endpoints in regulatory RA and risk management studies needs further development.  </p>"},{"location":"index.html#xsr-use-for-regulatory-research-development","title":"xSR Use for Regulatory Research &amp; Development","text":"<p>More realistic RA and risk management, more holistic evaluation of pesticide risk, integrated pest assessment, integrated cost/benefit ecosystem service assessments, are currently intensely discussed topics with a need for tools and data.

The SimID cannot be the same as a folder already contained in the run folder. If you want to run a simulation with the same SimID you need to delete this simulation folder first (from the ...\\run folder). PRZM Model behaviour     When PRZMeu is used as runoff component (as in the template run), the PRZM model shortly pops up on your Windows desktop, ie, gets focus and so might distract you from other work on your computer. This behaviour is by design of the PRZM model and Windows System and is unfortunately unavoidable. Temporary files     During runtime, xSR generates temporary files which use a specific folder. You need to either have C:\\temp on your drive,     or define your preferred folder in the parameterisation file (.xrun). In the latter case, make sure that the total length of the folder name is &lt;20 characters (due to PRZM model limitations).  </p>"},{"location":"getstarted/getstarted.html#parameterisation","title":"Parameterisation","text":"<p>xSR is built upon xLandscape.

For example, a scenario might consider how a pesticide behaves in sandy soil under high rainfall conditions. </li> <li>Biotic Factors: These involve living organisms that might be affected by the pesticide, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. The scenario might assess the impact on a specific species or a group of species. </li> <li>Agronomic Practices: This includes farming practices such as land use, crop rotation, land management, irrigation, and pesticide application methods.

The need for more realistic risk assessment was also identified in different pesticide risk assessment related workgroups (eg, European Workshop on Probabilistic Risk Assessment for the Environmental Impacts of PPPs (EUPRA, Hart 2001), FOCUS Landscape and Mitigation (FOCUS 2007a, 2007b)), as well as in more generic initiatives (eg, Water Framework Directive (WFD, EC 2000), Sustainable Use Directive (EC 2009b), United Nations 'Millennium Ecosystem Assessment' (2005)). In a phase of improved availability of environmental (geo)data together with the establishment of mechanistic models (eg, EC/Joined Research Centre), early approaches were built for more realistic exposure and risk assessment at landscape-level (eg, Almass, IVA/GeoPERA, Julius-K\u00fchn-Institut/GIS, UBA/GeoRISK). Although significant progress was made, these early approaches had particular deficiencies in how naturally given variability was propagated to outcome (resulting in unrealstic system conditions) and tended to be rather large and intransparent monoliths.

Represents key features of the modular landscape modelling approach. Components are connected to the core and controlled by the core (necessary minimum). Provides a multidimensional data store. Organises model inputs.</li> <li>Components: colloquial the modules of the modular approach. Represent the actual funtionality of a landscape model. Can be quite simple (eg, estimation of water temperature from air) or quite complex (eg, calculating substance transport in streams). Technically precise, components are build from wrapping scientific models (called 'the module of a component').</li> <li>xLandscape Models: an applicable landscape model for a specific purpose. The composition of components and the core (Example xLandscape Models). </li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>Illustration of the xLandscape ecosystem: components, Core, Models, as well as 'Analysis&amp;Reporting Elements' </p> <p>xLandscape Characteristics:</p> <ol> <li>Numeric approach that works with discretised entities: time is discretised in time steps (any step possible, 'hour' and 'day' are typical in different processes). Spatial entities can be eg, vector polygons or raster cells. This makes xLandscape a spatiotemporally explicit model.</li> <li>Explicit scales: phenomenons like variability are assigned to specific scales. Eg, variability of spray-drift deposition might be observed on a field-scale. Likewise, explicit scales serve as important units in the analysis of landscape modelling outcome, eg. to provide endpoints that fit to the definition of Specific Protection Goals.</li> <li>Monte Carlo: variability (and uncertainty) are represented by Probability Density Functions (PDFs). This, together with the spatiotemporally explicit approach, provides the functionality to propagate variability of landscape processes, activities and dynamics to landscape model outputs.  </li> <li>Multidimensional data storage: Environmental characteristics, agriculture, PPP use, exposure, effects and their attributes, space and time, make xLandscape a multidimensional approach. These data are stored in a  multidimensional storage. Currently, the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) is used. At the end of a xLandscape-based model simulation all data resides in the HDF store.</li> <li>Semantics: xLandscape introduces semantics to improve meaning of data. This is done in a stepwise way. Currently, values have a unit and scale assigned.</li> <li>Sequential processing: in version 1.x components are executed in a sequential order.</li> <li>'xcopy' distribution: an xLandscape-based model can be copied (downloaded) and used without installation. The xLandscape core comes with its Python environment and each component with their required runtime environment.</li> <li>Scalability: basically, the spatial and temporal extent, as well as other simulation characteristics (eg, the number and detail of endpoints) are only limited by computing ressources. Scaleability is a central requirement, also to the design of components. Ideally, processes should show a linear scaling behaviour. Besides actual landscape models build with xLandscape, the related analysis software need to cope with (large) raw data volumes typically generated.</li> <li>Scenarios: each specific model built with the xLandscape approach has its specific scenario requirements. As long as data requirements can be fulfilled, scenarios of any (global) region and any time period can be used as model input. Scenarios can be of any spatial shape.

Eg, the actually continuous (simulation) time is discretised into time steps (of any interval, often [day] or [hour]), spatial entities are discretised using resolutions depending on the individual process (eg, [1m2] for local spray-drift exposure, [100m] segments of stream networks). However, explicitness alone is not a sufficient means to represent natural variability of phenomenons, events and processes, of natural systems, eg, an explicit representation of land use (in space and time) requires that land use is deterministically know for the simulation region and the simulation period (eg use satellite classification). This is often not the case and only general knowledge is available (eg, statistical data and crop cultivation and rotation). Even if full deterministic data is available for a phenomenon (eg, for weather representation by using long-term records) the purpose of a landscape simulation might require to go beyond actual data and consider situations (eg, extremes) which are not part of an actual record. This is a typical situation in regulatory risk assessment where the range of conditions that might happen has to be considered in order for the (prospective) decision making to cover these. This is where the use of distributions comes in. In xLandscape, variability can be represented as Probability Density Functions (PDFs). Examples for using PDFs are wind direction distributions, PPP application windows and application rates, local spray-drift depositions in the (xDrift) component or drift-filtering by riparian vegetation. The scope of validity of a PDF and its elements have to be defined, eg, a weather conditions representing PDF might be valid for a certain geographic regions and a certain time period, it's elements might be valid for a certain day. Thus, samples drawn from this PDF are associated to the scales [region,day]. Irrespective which component asks for weather conditions, the result should be the same for the same region and day, but different for different regions and/or days (corresponding to the random sample of the PDF). This mechanism of scale-dependent definition and use of PDFs enables to build a Monte Carlo approach that generates naturally occuring pattern of the simulated agro-environmental system. In other words, real-world variability comes with pattern, ie, is not just random (an overly simple, independently sampling Monte Carlo approach would just generate chaotic situations).  </p> <p> </p> <p>Propagation of landscape agro-environmental system variability to variability of model predictions</p> <p> </p> <p>Real-world variability has structure, ie, comes with pattern</p>"},{"location":"xLandscape/xLandscape-v1x.html#components-modules-and-models","title":"Components, Modules and Models","text":"<p>You will read the term component quite often in the context of xLandscape. xLandscape is a modular landscape modelling framework that architecture is derived from Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE).

Corresponding multidimentsional data is stored using a multidimensional data store. At present, HDF is being used. All landscape model data as defined by the model designer is stored in an HDF store (basically, the in- and outputs of components). Data in the store can come in independent resolutions (eg, PPP use might be represented by the spatial scale field, whereas local exposure of off-field areas might be calculated and stored by m2 as spatial scale). The same applies to any other dimension and scale. As the multidimensional store contains the data relevant to the specific landscape model, it represents 'the landscape' of the model. Thus, 'the landscape' is built of such data/information that is defined by model design (and configuration).

In xCP, an Indication is an explicit part of its parameterisation. An Indication is made of PPP Application Sequences, at minimum one PPP Application Sequence. If more than one Application Sequence is defined in an Indication, these sequences are considered alternative Application sequences ('OR' related). Thus, the xCP parameterisation entity Indication can be used to define alternative PPP use pattern, eg, reflecting product market shares or fractions 'biological' or 'organic' pest control means. Multiple Indications can be defined in an xCP parameterisation, as many as necessary to represent a simple or complex real-world PPP use pattern in one or many crops.

They can be used to model phenomena with significant variability (and uncertainty) in inputs, such as calculating the possible exposure profile of pesticides in streams in a catchment and the variability of possible effects to aquatic organisms. A nested (2D) Monte Carlo approach allows to also assess consequences of uncertainties to model outcome.  </p> <p>The xLandscape model is a numeric approach that works spatially and temporally explicit. Some phenomenons can be considered deterministic, eg, land use at a certain location and time (as derived from satellite data) or when using historic weather data. However, real-world phenomenons are sometimes not exactly known in space and time, eg, farming activities, catchment conditions or local wind conditions. In such cases, variability distributions can be derived (from data and/or expert judgement), modelled using Monte Carlo, in order to assess the range of possible consequences for the environment and for species. This is done in an xLandscape model by defining an Experiment which consists of a number of Monte Carlo runs to sample the range of possible conditions of the defined real-world landscape system.  </p>"},{"location":"xLandscape/reference/glossary.html#parameterisation","title":"Parameterisation","text":"<p>As for each xLandscape component and landscape model, user simulation inputs and control settings are separated in two different levels, a Configuration and a Parameterisation level: - the Configuration of a component (like xCP) allows to change fundamental model behaviour (eg, minimum sprayed area, in-crop buffer calculation). - the parameterisation level of a component represent the actual user interface, ie, the model parameters exposed to the user. Inputs made by the user in the parameterisation file define a landscape modelling Experiment.  </p> <p>The decision on which model component parameters should be exposed as user interface in the parameterisation level depends on the purpose of the model and the user group.

At lower tiers of the risk assessment procedure, Scenarios are designed to represent realistic worst-case situations to ensure that the risk assessments are protective of human health and the environment. When getting more realistic, at higher-tier risk assessment levels, Scenarios are intended to represent real-world conditions. Some key elements that define a scenario in this context:</p> <ol> <li>Abiotic Factors: These include non-living environmental factors such as soil type, climate/weather, landscape topology, and water bodies. For example, a scenario might consider how a pesticide behaves in sandy soil under high rainfall conditions. </li> <li>Biotic Factors: These involve living organisms that might be affected by the pesticide, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. The scenario might assess the impact on a specific species or a group of species. </li> <li>Agronomic Practices: This includes farming practices such as land use, crop rotation, land management, irrigation, and pesticide application methods. Different practices can influence how pesticides are distributed and degraded in the environment. </li> <li>Exposure Pathways: Scenarios consider how habitats and species might be exposed to pesticides, such as through forage, water, or contact. </li> <li>Temporal Aspects: The timing of pesticide application, its persistence in the environment and temporal relationship to the occurrence of species are crucial. Scenarios might model short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) exposures.  </li> </ol> <p>By combining these factors, scenarios build a crucial basis to create a comprehensive picture of the potential risks associated with pesticide use.</p> <p>In xCP, the term PPP use scenario is sometimes used to address a certain Parameterisation of xCP (as part of a landscape model).  Likewise, modellers often talk about a landscape scenario meaning the certain geographic region for which eg, land use/cover, soil, weather and habitat conditions have been defined as basis for landscape-scale pesticide exposure and effect modelling. </p>"},{"location":"xLandscape/reference/glossary.html#simulation","title":"Simulation","text":"<p>The term Simulation is not precisely defined and is used somehow colloquial with different meanings.
